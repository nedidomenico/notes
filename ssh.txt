ssh window tunneling
  ssh -X user@host

Checking for existing SSH keys
  ssh-add -l
  ssh-add -E md5 -l
  ls -al ~/.ssh

Create and add ssh keys to local ssh agent
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   -  Accept default file location & file names! 
   -  Enter passphrase

Start the ssh-agent in the background.
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  
Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Get ssh fingerprint:
  ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ssh-keygen -E md5 -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Add ssh public key to server
  eval $(ssh-agent -s)
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ssh-copy-id user@host

Add the public key
  vim ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

X11 forwarding
================================================================================
Your client must be set up to forward X11.
Your server must be set up to allow X11 forwarding.
Your server must be able to set up X11 authentication.

On the client side, the -X (capital X) option to ssh enables X11 forwarding, and you can make this the default (for all
connections or for a specific conection) with ForwardX11 yes in ~/.ssh/config.

On the server side, X11Forwarding yes must specified in /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Note that the default is no forwarding
(some distributions turn it on in their default /etc/ssh/sshd_config), and that the user cannot override this setting.

The xauth program must be installed on the server side. If there are any X11 programs there, it's very likely that
xauth will be there. In the unlikely case xauth was installed in a nonstandard location, it can be called through
~/.ssh/rc (on the server!).

Note that you do not need to set any environment variables on the server. DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY will automatically be
set to their proper values. If you run ssh and DISPLAY is not set, it means ssh is not forwarding the X11 connection.

To confirm that ssh is forwarding X11, check for a line containing Requesting X11 forwarding in the ssh -v -X output.
Note that the server won't reply either way, a security precaution of hiding details from potential attackers.
