Hey Peter I hope everything is going well.

I am wondering if you have time to chat later today or later this week. I recently got an opportunity to live in Lisbon, Portugal. I am hoping you will give me some options to avoid loosing money needlessly on rent in Charlottesville. I would like to leave in August sometime.

I still feel slightly bad about jerking you guys around a bit back in 2016 haha. So let me assure you I have made up my mind to go. I will maybe some things here and leave my car with a friend in cville, but I might not return to live in Charlottesville on a permanent basis.

I have really enjoyed living in your condo for the past 3+ years, and you have been very fair to me. Rest assured I will not create a situation where you will miss a monthly check, be it from me or someone else.

I was thinking I could sublet the place as a fully furnished apartment, then come back in March of 2020 to move all my stuff out, or you could find another tenant and I could move all my stuff out next month (if the new tenant did not want to buy mt stuff off me)

These are two great options for me. I hope you will work with me to make one of them happen. We can certainly chat about it later.

Thanks!
