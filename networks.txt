TCP/IP Basics
========================================================================================================================

* Internet Layer Protocols
* IPv4 (sometimes you just say IP)
* IPv6
* ICMP
* Transport Layer Protocols
  * TCP
  * UDP
* Application Layer Protocols
  * HTTP
* IP Addresses
  * IPv4 = 32-bit value
  * ipconfig and ifconfig commands
  * IP Addresses in Action
  * Network ID + Host ID
* Default gateway + routing tables connect LANs to LANs
* With a network ID of 202.120.10.0 a network is limited to IP addresses from 202.120.10.1 to 202.120.10.254.
  * subnet masks
      IP Address    192.168.5.23      11000000.10101000.00000101.00010111
      Subnet mask   255.255.255.0     11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
      Network ID    192.168.5.0       11000000.10101000.00000101.x
      Host ID       x.x.x.23          x.x.x.00010111

      Before a computer sends out any data, it first compares the destination IP address to its own IP
      address using the subnet mask. If the destination IP address matches the computer’s IP wherever
      there’s a 1 in the subnet mask, then the sending computer knows the destination is local
  * IF Computer A’s and Computer B’s network IDs match! It’s a local call. Knowing this,
    Computer A can now send out an ARP request, which is a broadcast, as shown in Figure 7-24, to
    determine Computer B’s MAC address. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is how a TCP/IP
    network figures out the MAC address based on the destination IP address
  * Most network folks represent subnet masks using special shorthand: a / character followed by
    a number equal to the number of ones in the subnet mask. Here are a few examples:
      11111111111111111111111100000000 = /24 (24 ones)
      11111111111111110000000000000000 = /16 (16 ones)
      11111111000000000000000000000000 = /8 (8 ones)
  * Class IDs
      Class A 1–126 1.0.0.0–126.255.255.255 16,277,214
      Class B 128–191 128.0.0.0–191.255.255.255 65,534
      Class C 192–223 192.0.0.0–223.255.255.255 254
      Class D 224–239 224.0.0.0–239.255.255.255 Multicast
      Class E 240–254 240.0.0.0–254.255.255.255 Experimental
  * CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing) and Subnetting
    * CIDR and subnetting are virtually the same thing. Subnetting
      is done by an organization—it is given a block of addresses and then breaks the single block of
      addresses into multiple subnets. CIDR is done by an ISP—it is given a block of addresses, subnets
    * All subnetting begins with a single network ID. In this scenario, you
      need to convert the 192.168.4.0/24 network ID for the café into three network IDs:
      the block into multiple subnets, and then passes out the smaller individual subnets to customers.
    * Now draw a second line one digit to the right, as shown in Figure 7-31. You’ve now separated
      the subnet mask into three areas that I call (from left to right) the default subnet mask (DSM),
      the network ID extension (NE), and the hosts (H). These are not industry terms, so you won’t see
      them on the CompTIA Network+ exam, but they’re a handy Mike Trick that makes the process
      of subnetting a lot easier.
    * See page 200
    * Subnetting most commonly takes place in two situations: ISPs that
      receive network blocks from IANA and then subnet those blocks for customers, and very large
      customers that take subnets (sometimes already subnetted class blocks from ISPs) and make their
      own subnets.
    * You need to think of subnets in terms of CIDR values like /8, /22, /26, and so on.
* IP Address Assignment
  * Static IP Addressing
  * Dynamic IP Addressing (DHCP)
    * All DHCP clients are designed to generate an APIPA address automatically if they do not
      receive a response to a DHCP Discover message. If you can’t get to the Internet, use whatever tool your OS
      provides to check your IP address. If it’s an APIPA address, you know instantly that you have a DHCP problem
      use:
        sudo ifconfig eth0 down
        sudo ifconfig eth0 up
  * Special IP Addresses
     * 127.0.0.1—the loopback address
     * private IP addresses
        * 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255 (1 Class A network block)
        * 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255 (16 Class B network blocks)
        * 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255 (256 Class C network blocks)

  * netstat –r command
* Network Address Translation - 230
  * Hides the IP addresses of computers on the LAN but still enable those computers to communicate with the broader
    Internet.
  * Classic Setup:
    * First, you need to get a block of legitimate, unique, expensive IP addresses from an (ISP). You purchase a
      network ID—say, 1.2.3.136/29.
    * Second, you assign an IP address to each computer and to the LAN connection on the router.
    * Third, you assign the IP address for the ISP’s router to the WAN connection on the local router.
    * All of the clients on the network have the same default gateway.This router, called a gateway router,
      acts as the default gateway for a number of client computers.
  * This style of network mirrors how computers in LANs throughout the world connected to the Internet for the first 20
    years, but the major problems of security and a finite number of IP addresses worsened as more and more computers
    connected.
  * NAT solved both of these issues for many years. NAT is a simple concept: the router replaces the source IP address
    of a computer with its outside interface address on outgoing packets.
  * The simplest NAT, called basic NAT, does exactly that, translating the private or internal IP address to a global
    IP address on a one-to-one basis.
* Port Address Translation - 232
  * Most internal networks use a block of private IP addresses for the hosts inside the network. They connect to the
    Internet through one or more public IP addresses.
  * The most common form of NAT that handles this one-to-many connection—called Port Address Translation (PAT)—uses
    port numbers to map traffic from specific machines in the network.
    * PAT uses port numbers to map traffic from specific machines in the network.
* Port Forwarding - 234
  * The obvious drawback to relying exclusively on PAT for network address translation is that it only works for
    outgoing communication, not incoming communication.

    With port forwarding, you can designate a specific local address for various network services.
    Computers outside the network can request a service using the public IP address of the router and
    the port number of the desired service. The port-forwarding router would examine the packet,
    look at the list of services mapped to local addresses, and then send that packet along to the proper
    recipient.
    You can use port forwarding to hide a service hosted inside your network by changing the
    default port number for that service. To hide an internal Web server, for example, you could
    change the request port number to something other than port 80, the default for HTTP traffic.
    The router in Figure 8-16, for example, is configured to forward all port 8080 packets to the
    internal Web server at port 80.
* Dynamic NAT - 236

Dynamic Routing
* Routing Metrics - 238
* Distance Vector and Path Vector - 239
  * RIPv1, RIPv2
  * BGP - 244
    * Autonomous System Number
    * Exterior Gateway Protocol
    * Interior Gateway Protocols
      Neither EGP nor IGP is a dynamic routing protocol; rather these are terms used by the large Internet
      service providers to separate their interconnected routers using ASNs from other interconnected
      networks that are not part of this special group of companies. The easy way to keep these terms
      separate is to appreciate that although many protocols are used within Autonomous Systems, such
      as RIP, the Internet has settled on one protocol for communication between each AS: the Border
      Gateway Protocol (BGP-4). BGP is the glue of the Internet, connecting all of the Autonomous
      Systems. Other dynamic routing protocols such as RIP are, by definition, IGP. The current ver-
      sion of BGP is BGP-4.
