Chris and Nathan,

Nice job identifying all of these.  Many of these are worth including.  Maybe focus on a few to start with?  Here are what I think are the most important (some may need to be added to the full list):

DBScan:numClusters

com.ccri.volans.imagery.dl4j Dl4jBasicChipConsumer
 - Processing $nChips in thread $threadName
 - Chip Creation Rate (chips/sec) = $chipRate
 - INDArray Creation Rate (chips/sec) = $ndRate
 - Classification Rate (chips/sec) = $classRate
 - Scoring Rate (chips/sec) = $scoreRate
 - Package Rate (chips/sec) = $packRate
 - Consume Rate (chips/sec) = $consumeRate
 - Group successfully processed : thread-metadata

BasicInferenceSingle and BasicInferenceListener:
logger.info(s"Total number of detections: ${detectionCount.get}")
logger.info(s"Total number of chips processed: ${chipCount.get}")
val procTime = (System.currentTimeMillis - tic) / 1000
logger.info(s"Processing time (s): $procTime")
logger.info(s"ProcessingRate (chips/s): ${chipCount.get.toDouble / procTime}")
logger.info(s"Done processing ${imgFile.getName}")
