To renew your certification, you will need to score a 100% on all the assessments. All assessments can be reset from
the assessment review page until you reach mastery. Once you complete all assessments at 100%, your certification record
will be updated automatically.

If you're already confident about the objectives listed in a lesson, you can use "Quick Notes" to review objectives
related to the assessment quickly before taking it. You can then jump directly to the assessment. IF you're unsure or
unfamiliar with the content, click "Continue" to review the "Full Content" lesson, which provides detailed descriptions
of all objectives, along with supporting content. Once confident, you can click "Continue" again to take the assessment.
