Hey Baby, I was thinking about how you said you were worrying about money and I also had
concerns about what we were going to do after I visit Lisbon. I kind of thought a different plan
My main goals are still to see you and I am not trying to complicate things by suggesting this.

It might have certain advantages such as:
  Making you less worried about money
  Making me less worried about when to do Australia trips!
  Making ME less worried about money
  Giving me more time to get things in order to leave Cville

Anyways here is an outline of the new plan:

Now till August (08/2019)
  - We both stay in our current situations
  - Maybe you come visit me in this time? (I would really hope for that)
  - In late August I move out of my apartment
  - I will apply for an Australian work / holiday visa in this time

August - October (10/2019)
  - I live cheaply with a freind (Nate, Will, Lisa, Clay ... there are lots of options)
    I can save a lot of money this way
  - You work and stay with your Mom and Dad. You can make a lot of money doing this

October (10/2019)
  - You will have your Australia visa, so you go to Australia.
    Maybe you can even fly there from Shanghai? (That's a shorter flight!)

December or January (12/2019)
  - I join you in Australia
  - I will have all my stuff sold and will have saved a lot of money so I won't
    be worried about making as much when I am there
  - You will be less worried about money too as you worked all that time without
    paying rent

We stay in Australia and travel around there as long as we want and then we both go to Lisbon
and live there for a little while and then who knows?
